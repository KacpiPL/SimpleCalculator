# Flask Arithmetic Calculator

A simple Flask application to perform basic arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on query parameters.

## Overview

This application defines a Flask server with a single endpoint, `/calculate`, that performs mathematical operations. You can specify the operation type and two numbers in the query parameters, and the app will return the result as a string.
